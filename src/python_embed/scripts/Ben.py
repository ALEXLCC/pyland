"""
Welcome to Pyland!

There's a lot to learn, but not that much to remember:



* Press "e" to open the editor

* Press "?" to get help about what to do now

* Press "+" and "-" to zoom



* Press "r" to run scripts

* Press "h" to stop a script



* Press Escape to quit

* Hold Shift to speed up scripts



Note that this file is run by Python, but

* anything between tripple quotes (like this text) or
* anything directly following a hash

is ignored by Python.

This lets you annotate your code with useful information
about what it does and how it works.

#
# This code outputs help
# to the screen.
#
# It's the same as pressing "?"
#
# Also try "help(move)" and "help(walkable)"
#
help()


#
# This is some code to use for the first task.
# It moves east 100 times.
#
# Remove the tripple quotes on both sides to
# be able to run this script.
